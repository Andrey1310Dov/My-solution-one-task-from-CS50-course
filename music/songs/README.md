ASCII alone doesn’t lend itself to sheet music, we’ve instead adopted for these files a "machine-readable" format for songs instead.
On each line of a file is a note and duration, separated by an @. 
For exzample (effect of # and b, otherwise known as accidentals, is to raise or lower, respectively, the pitch of a note by one semitone):

F4@1/8
G4@1/8
Bb4@1/8
G4@1/8
Bb4@1/8
C5@1/4
A4@1/4
